# A small Videogame project for GMTK Game Jam 2022
The dice lived in peace in the casino with the cards, until one day, in an unfortunate turn of events,  the dice are separated, and our protagonist decides to take justice into their own hands.

No Time To Di(c)e is a top-down shooter where you seek revenge to save your dice friend.
